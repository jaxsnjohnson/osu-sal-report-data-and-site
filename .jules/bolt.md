## 2024-02-02 - Large Client-Side Data Initialization
**Learning:** This project loads a 95MB JSON file on the client. Naive initialization involving multiple passes (Data Processing + History Stats + Role Collection) resulted in 3x full dataset traversals. On large datasets, "one pass" architecture is critical for TTI.
**Action:** Always check dataset size `ls -lh` before optimizing. Merge initialization loops into a single pass when possible. Pre-calculate derived values (like cleaned numbers) during the initial pass to avoid repetitive parsing in hot paths (like search/filter).
